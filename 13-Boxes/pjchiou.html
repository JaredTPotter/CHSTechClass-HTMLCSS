        <div class="box">Once uppon a time there was a little brown bear. It was wondering around in the forest when a bib bad hunter shot his mother and he had to watch as she bled out and then was skinned.
        He wandered around hopelesly in the woods, trying to find something to eat. Seeing as his mother was negligent and didn't teach him he neccasary life skills, he starved to death after a few days.</div>
