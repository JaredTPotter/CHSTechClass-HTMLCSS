           <h2> <b> <i> What is the chief end of man? </i> </b> </h2>
           <p> The chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. </p>
           <h2> <b> <i> What rule hath God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy Him? </i> </b> </h2>
           <p> The Word of God, which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him.</p>
           <h2> <b> <i> What do the Scriptures principally teach? </i> </b> </h2>
           <p> The Scriptures principally teach what man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man. <p>
           <h2> <b> <i> What is God? </i> </b> </h2>
           <p> God is a spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness and truth. </p>
           <h2> <b> <i> Are there more Gods than one? </i> </b> </h2>
           <p> There is but one only, the living and true God. </p>
           <h2> <b> <i> How many persons are there in the Godhead? </i> </b> </h2>
           <p> There are three persons in the Godhead; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one God, the same in substance, equal in power and glory. </p>
