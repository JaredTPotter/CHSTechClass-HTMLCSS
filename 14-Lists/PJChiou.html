        <div class="box">Once upon a time there was a little brown bear. It was wandering around in the forest when a big bad hunter shot his mother and he had to watch as she bled out and then was skinned.
        He wandered around hopelesly in the woods, trying to find something to eat. Seeing as his mother was negligent and didn't teach him he neccasary life skills, he starved to death after a few days, and his carcas can still be seen rotting on the ground, mostly absorbed into the moss.</div>
